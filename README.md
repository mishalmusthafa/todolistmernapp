# TODO APP

The app allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks. On the backend, I used Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose for object modeling. I implemented user authentication using JSON Web Tokens and bcrypt for password hashing. The frontend is built with React, leveraging Redux Toolkit for state management. I used Axios for HTTP requests, React Toastify for notifications, and styled the app using Tailwind CSS with Daisy UI components.
